1.What is the significance of return 0; at the end of the main program? Is it actually needed?
Answer:
The ANSI definition requires int preceding main. Hoever, since many compilars can trun off ANSI compatibility, it's not actually needed.


2.What, if anything, is wrong with the following code?

int main() {  
    float x = 41.5;  
    printf("The value of x is %d", x);  
}  
Answer:
%d is stands for the integer, while x is a float. If the code runs, the .5 will not be showed, and 41 is not the real value of x.


3.What, if anything, is wrong with this implementation of the equation g = -G m / r^2 (the gravitational field equation)?
g = -G * m / r * r
Answer:
The G and g are vectors, but m or r is not.


4.What is the difference between ++var and var++?
Answer:
If y=++var, y=var+1, var=var+1;
If y=var++, y=var, var=var+1.
