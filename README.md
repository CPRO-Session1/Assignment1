# Assignment1

## Objectives
Get comfortable with simple output, variables, and data types by practicing them in a simple program.
Learn how to submit assignments on GitHub.

### Part 1
Write a program `initials.c` to print your initials formed by rows of asterisks, for instance:
```
      ***         ***     ***
      ***         ***     ***
      ***         ***     ***
      ***         ***********
      ***         ***     ***
      ***         ***     ***
      *********   ***     ***
```

### Part 2
In a text file `assignment1.txt`, answer the following questions:

1.  What is the significance of `return 0;` at the end of the main program?  Is it actually needed?

2.  What, if anything, is wrong with the following code?

    ```c
    int main() {  
        float x = 41.5;  
        printf("The value of x is %d", x);  
    }  
    ```
3.  What, if anything, is wrong with this implementation of the equation g = -G m / r^2 (the gravitational field equation)?

    g = -G * m / r * r
