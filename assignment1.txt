Julia Tan

1. The 'return 0' at the end of the program is a convention that represents the success of the program. It is required for C programs.

2. Instead of "%d", it should say "%f" because the variable 'x' is a float, not an integer.

3. "r * r" should be in brackets so that the denominator of the fraction in the right side of the equation is "r^2" not "r". (Program reads left to right)

4. ++var is a prefix operator, while var++ is a postfix operator.
They both increase the value of var by 1. However, the order of the increment and the value assignment differs.

Example:
int a = 0, var = 0;

a = ++var;
The value of var is incremented, then its value is assigned to a.
The new values of the variables are: a = 1 and var = 1

a = var++;
The value of var is assigned to a, then var is incremented by 1.
The new values of the variables are: a = 0 and var = 1
