1. what is the significance of `return 0;` at the end of the main program?  Is it actually needed?

it checks whether the main function exit is successful.

2.  What, if anything, is wrong with the following code?

    ```c
    int main() {
        float x = 41.5;
        printf("The value of x is %d", x);
    }
    ```
In the line printf("This value of x is %d", x" the letter "d" should be replaced with "f" because x is a float not a double.

3.  What, if anything, is wrong with this implementation of the equation g = -G m / r^2 (the gravitational field equation)?

    g = -G * m / r * r

Because the program reads from left to right, it will solve [ -G * m/r ] then multiply that by r. Instead, it should solve [ -G * m] then divide it by [r *r ]

4. What is the difference between ++var and var++?
int x = 0; 
int var = 0;
x = ++var;

returns x = 1;
returns var = 1;

int x = 0;
int var = 0;
var++;

returns x = 0;
returns var = 1;

++var is a prefix operator, therefore, var is incremented BEFORE its value is set to x. However, var++ is a postfix operator, therefore, it increments the value of var AFTER its value is set to x. Hence x returns different values in each example.
