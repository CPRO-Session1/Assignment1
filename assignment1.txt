1) The significance of return 0 is that it allows for the person to see if the code compiled correctly.
 An integer needs to be returned if the function is delcared "int function".

2) The issue in the code is that the operator is wrong; the operator should be "%f" instead "%d".

3) The issue with that implementation of the equation is the computer wil divide the product of -G and m by r the multiply that number by.
so the r squared acts like a times 1 instead of r squared. To fix this parenthesis should be put around the r*r.

4) ++v change the value of the variable first while v++ does it after.
