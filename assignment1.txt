Olivier Gabison - Answers to Part 2.

1. return 0; represents a return from the main function; which gives your computer an exit value.
2. Code:
int main() {
    float x = 41.5;
    printf("The value of x is %d", x);
}
Error: In C, %d is used for integers, in this case it's using it for floats which is not correct.
3. The order of operations are incorrect here.

4. The difference of var++ and ++var is that when using them, for var++ the result given to you is the variable before
incrementing. And ++var is the result of the variable after incrementing.
