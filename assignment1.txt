1. Because of the standards, the code requires a return number to tell the program that the code runs smoothly and has no flaws, this helps further execute the code. If using the standard, return 0 is needed, because main is recognised as an integer. However, in this version, because the gcc is able to compile and give some leway, retun 0 isn't required in my version.
2. I think that %d doesn't make sense because % symbol is used for remainder and there should be one number dividing by the other in other to find the remainder of the mathematical equation.**?
3. Order of operations is important here and parentheses are required around the numerator and denominator. Eg g= (-G*m)/(r*r)
4. ++var is prefix and var++ is postfix.
Example:
int x,y;
x=1;
y=(x++*3);
This would lead to y=x+(1*3)=1+3=4
while Example:
int x,y;
x=1;
y=(++x*3);
would lead to y=(1+x)*3=2*3=6
